""Started"" is a hip hop song, with a length of three minutes and six seconds. It was written by Azalea and Ronny Wright and produced by J. White Did It, who had also produced Azalea's previous single ""Sally Walker"". The track finds Azalea boasting, ""I started from the bottom and now I'm rich... You started out hating, now you love my drip."" It is described as an unapologetic ""brag-heavy cut [...] club banger about making your way to success after having nothing"" and was noted to borrowing and twisting the Drake line ""started from the bottom,"" by adding ""and now I'm rich""."

Can’t relate,"" and implied the visuals would reference Smith.
